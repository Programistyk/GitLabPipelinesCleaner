# GitLabPipelinesCleaner

A very basic app to let me refresh some decade old knowledge about C# and .net, made to ease management of private GitLab CE instance.

Application is using Gitlab's API to selective remove old pipelines.
Written in .net 4.7.2 using [GitLabApiClient](https://github.com/nmklotas/GitLabApiClient)

Kudos to [Vasq](https://vaslogos.com/) for application icon!
